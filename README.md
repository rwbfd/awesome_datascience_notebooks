# Awesome Data Science Notebooks

## What is this repo about
This repo is a collection of notebooks for various purposes, including tabular data mining, NLP, CV, RL and more. 

Orinally the repo is created to collect all the commonly used data science routines. However, it soon became too fragmented. Therefore, I have opted to fork repos like tf, pytorch, transformers, flax etc. Waiting for merge might never happen, so I have kept my own version in my github pages. However, Tabular Mining Methods will be a stand-alone repo. 

## How to run the notebooks
All the notebooks should run as it is on CoLab. I will include the instructions on how to run it.

## Want to contribute? 
Awesome. Just raise an issue and we will discuss the idea.
